# ðŸ§¡ Multiple Sclerosis is a journey I never planned or asked for

But I choose to **LOVE LIFE, HATE THE DISEASE, AND FIGHT**. ðŸ§¡  
Life challenges us in ways we could never imagine â€” yet we always have one incredible power: the way we think.  
âœ¨ Your thinking can shape your reality. Never forget it. ðŸ’ªðŸ§¡
