# MS-My Style ☕🌍

**MS (Multiple Sclerosis)**, for me, is not just a challenge—it’s *My Style* 💪. It’s part of how I live, think, and grow 🌱.

My journey so far has been full of difficulties, challenges, victories 🏆, and losses 💔, and every day brings its own mix of small wins, reflections 🤔, and moments of joy 😊. I embrace life fully, navigating the ups and downs with my own pace and perspective, turning what some see as limits into a unique way of experiencing the world 🌈.  

Some days are easier than others. There are mornings when just getting out of bed feels like an achievement, and evenings when I can sit quietly, sip a coffee, and watch the sunset with a sense of calm. On other days, the fatigue hits hard, reminding me of the importance of pacing myself and being gentle with my body.  

Through it all, I’ve learned to celebrate **small victories**: a walk in the park with my kids without feeling drained, finishing a work project that seemed impossible, or simply laughing at something silly with friends. These moments may seem ordinary to some, but for me, they carry a deep sense of accomplishment and gratitude.  

I also love exploring new hobbies and passions. Sometimes it’s cooking a new recipe 🍝, sometimes it’s diving into a series I’ve been meaning to watch 📺, or taking spontaneous bike rides around Berlin 🚴‍♂️. Each activity, even the small ones, helps me feel alive and connected.

## Daily Life & Mindset

Living with MS has taught me the importance of **mindset**. How I approach each day can make a huge difference in how I experience it. Choosing patience, kindness toward myself, and appreciation for the little things helps me navigate challenges without losing hope.  

I try to focus on what I *can* do rather than what I can’t. Even small adjustments—like planning my day around my energy levels, taking breaks when needed, or practicing mindfulness—create a sense of control and balance in my life.

## Family & Relationships

My children are a constant source of inspiration and motivation. Their energy, curiosity, and laughter remind me to celebrate life, no matter how challenging a day may be.  

Friendships and connections also play a vital role. Surrounding myself with people who understand, support, and share moments of joy or humor makes the journey lighter and more meaningful.

## Adventures & Curiosity

Even with limitations, I make room for adventure. From spontaneous trips to nature walks, exploring new neighborhoods in Berlin, or trying new experiences, I embrace opportunities that bring learning and joy.  

Curiosity drives me—whether it’s discovering a new hobby, experimenting with cooking, or diving into a new book or series. Every little exploration adds color to my life.

This blog is my way of sharing all these experiences—the highs, the lows, the little victories, and the reflections that come with living fully despite challenges. My hope is that through sharing, I can inspire others to find their own way of embracing life, no matter the obstacles.

The idea behind this blog is to share a mix of the journey I’ve made so far 🛤️ and the everyday situations, thoughts 💭, and reflections I experience—a honest intersection of past and present, challenges and small joys 🌟.
